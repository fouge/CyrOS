CyrOS
------------------------------------------

Kernel I started in order to learn !
There is no bootloader included. Qemu's "-kernel" option is used for testing.

Based on OSdev.org tutorials.

Fonctions I implemented : 
 - Support for Newlines to Terminal Driver
 - Terminal Scrolling
 - Colorful Rendering

 Works in Real Mode (for the moment).
